GPTSwift is a lightweight and convenient wrapper around the OpenAI API. It is completely written in Swift.

Using GPTSwift is easy:

```swift
import ChatGPT

let chatGPT = ChatGPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", defaultModel: .gpt3)
let answer = try await chatGPT.ask("What is the answer to life, the universe and everything in it?")

// Stream the answer token by token
var streamedAnswer = ""
for try await nextWord in try await chatGPT.streamedAnswer.ask("Tell me a story about birds") {
  streamedAnswer += nextWord
}
```

An example project can be found here: [GPTPlayground](https://github.com/SwiftedMind/GPTPlayground/tree/main)

## Getting Started

### Requirements

GPTSwift supports iOS 15+, macOS 12+, watchOS 8+ and tvOS 15+.

### Installation

The package is installed through the Swift Package Manager. Simply add the following line to your `Package.swift` dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftedMind/GPTSwift", from: "3.0.0")
```

Alternatively, if you want to add the package to an Xcode project, go to `File` > `Add Packages...` and enter the URL "https://github.com/SwiftedMind/GPTSwift" into the search field at the top. GPTSwift should appear in the list. Select it and click "Add Package" in the bottom right.

## How to Use

GPTSwift is just a lightweight wrapper around the API that abstracts away all the unnecessary details of calling endpoints and handling requests and responses.

### ChatGPT

The `ChatGPT` target gives you access to the ChatGPT API (including the GPT4 models).

The easiest way of using `ChatGPT` is by simply passing in a prompt string or an array of chat messages via the `ask(_:)` and `ask(messages:)` methods. These take care of turning the arguments into a request as well as parsing the response. All you get is the answer as a simple string, which is often all that's needed.

```swift
import ChatGPT

func askChatGPT() async throws {
  let chatGPT = ChatGPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", defaultModel: .gpt3)

  // Basic query
  let firstResponse = try await chatGPT.ask("What is the answer to life, the universe and everything in it?")
  print(firstResponse)

  // Send multiple messages
  let secondResponse = try await chatGPT.ask(
      messages: [
          ChatMessage(role: .system, content: "You are a dog."),
          ChatMessage(role: .user, content: "Do you actually like playing fetch?")
      ],
      model: .gpt3.stableVersion() // Override default model, if needed
  )
  print(secondResponse)
}
```
                                                                                 
However, if you need full control, you can also pass a `ChatRequest` to the `ask(request:)` method. With this, you can adjust all parameters and have access to the full response object, while everything is still fully type-safe.
                                                                 
```swift
import ChatGPT

func askChatGPT() async throws {
  let chatGPT = ChatGPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", defaultModel: .gpt3)

  let fullRequest = ChatRequest.gpt3 { request in
    request.messages = [
        .init(role: .system, content: "You are the pilot of an alien UFO. Be creative."),
        .init(role: .user, content: "Where do you come from?")
    ]
    request.temperature = 0.8
    request.numberOfAnswers = 2
  }

  let response = try await chatGPT.ask(request: fullRequest)
  print(response.choices.map(\.message))
}
```

Finally, all of the above methods have a variant that lets you stream GPT's answer token by token, right as they are generated. The stream is provided via an `AsyncThrowingStream`. All you have to do is add a `streamedAnswer` before the call to `ask()`. For example:

```swift
import ChatGPT

// In your view model
@Published var gptAnswer = ""

func askChatGPT() async throws {
  let chatGPT = ChatGPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")

  gptAnswer = ""
  for try await nextWord in try await chatGPT.streamedAnswer.ask("Tell me a funny story about birds") {
      gptAnswer += nextWord
  }
}
```

For more information about the ChatGPT API, you can look at OpenAI's documentation:
- [ChatGPT API Introduction](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/chat-completions-beta)
- [ChatGPT API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create)


### GPT
                                                                                                      
Like `ChatGPT`, `GPT` is a wrapper around the completion API. There is a basic `complete(_:)` method for convenient use, as well as a `complete(request:)` method that gives you full control.

```swift
import GPT

func askGPT() async throws {
  let gpt = GPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", defaultModel: .davinci)

  let response = try await gpt.complete("What is the answer to life, the universe and everything in it?")
  print(response)
}                                                                                                      
```
                                                                            
```swift
import GPT

func askGPT() async throws {
  let gpt = GPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", defaultModel: .davinci)

  let fullRequest = CompletionRequest.davinci(prompt: "Why is the sky blue?") { request in
      request.temperature = 0.8
      request.numberOfAnswers = 2
  }

  let response = try await gpt.complete(request: fullRequest)
  print(response.choices.map(\.text))
}                                                                                                      
```
                                                                            
Additionally, just like `ChatGPT`, `GPT` also supports streaming answers:
                                                                            
```swift
import GPT

// In your view model
@Published var gptAnswer = ""

func askGPT() async throws {
  let gpt = GPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")

  gptAnswer = ""
  for try await nextWord in try await gpt.streamedAnswer.complete("Tell me a funny story about birds") {
      gptAnswer += nextWord
  }
}
```

### OpenAI

Finally, you can access the available models through the `OpenAI` class.

```swift
import OpenAI

func openAI() async throws {
  let openAI = OpenAI(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")

  let models = try await openAI.availableModels()
  let model = try await openAI.model(withId: "gpt-3.5-turbo")
}
```

## Generating cURL Prompts

Sometimes, it might be useful to see the generated requests, so all three classes introduced above come with methods that generate a usable `cURL` prompt from a request that you can simply paste into a terminal. For example:

```swift
import ChatGPT

func askChatGPT() async throws {
  let chatGPT = ChatGPT(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", defaultModel: .gpt3)

  let request = ChatRequest.gpt3 { request in
      request.messages = [
          .init(role: .system, content: "You are the pilot of an alien UFO. Be creative."),
          .init(role: .user, content: "Where do you come from?")
      ]
      request.numberOfAnswers = 2
  }

  try await print(chatGPT.curl(for: request))
}
```

This generates the following:

```
curl --request POST \
--url 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
--data '{"messages":[{"content":"You are the pilot of an alien UFO. Be creative.","role":"system"},{"content":"Where do you come from?","role":"user"}],"model":"gpt-3.5-turbo","n":2,"stream":false}' | json_pp

```
